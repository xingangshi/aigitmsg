# AI-powered Git Commit Function
#
# Copy paste this shell into your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc to gain the `gcm` command. It:
# 1) gets the current staged changed diff
# 2) sends them to an LLM to write the git commit message
# 3) allows you to easily accept, edit, regenerate, cancel
#
# But - just read and edit the code however you like
#
# the `llm` CLI util is awesome, can get it here: https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/

# Unalias gcm if it exists (to prevent conflicts)
unalias gcm 2>/dev/null

# Define the AI-powered gcm function using gemini
gcm() {
    # Function to generate commit message using the gemini model
    generate_commit_message() {
        git diff --cached | llm -m gemini-1.5-flash-latest "
Below is a diff of all staged changes, coming from the command:
